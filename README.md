# LockDin

If you’ve ever attempted to study with friends, you’ve learned that four heads are almost never better than one. What starts as a focused group work session quickly turns into a social hangout, encouraging distractions and procrastination. You can’t help it, it’s tough to stay accountable with great company.

That’s where LockDin comes in. Our app is designed to keep you and your friends on track, so you have time for what really matters. Here’s how it works: You and your group set shared study timers and each commit a determined amount of money to the challenge. If you stay LockDin the entire time, congrats! You keep your money. However if you don’t your contribution is automatically donated to LockDin’s charity of the month. No excuses, no loopholes.

This simple accountability system encourages focused group study with a financial incentive, scalable to as much money in the game or focus time your group is looking for. Unlike traditional productivity tools, LockDin is social by design. You can monitor group progress, rile up your competitive spirit, and expand your study community.

Whether you’re cramming for finals, pursuing passion projects, or just trying to read more books, LockDin helps you follow through.
